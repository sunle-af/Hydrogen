# Meet Hydrogen!
Meet my project Hydrogen: a Java compiler that's as simple as a hydrogen atom—innocent and small, but handle it wrong and boom, instant explosion !

I don’t want to bore you with the nitty-gritty of how compilers are made, but if you’ve tackled data structures and algorithms, you’ll know that string manipulation is crucial. At its core, a compiler breaks down a language into manageable pieces. First, it uses a tokenizer (or lexer) to convert the language into tokens. These tokens are then passed to a parser, which generates the intermediate code. Finally, this code is translated into assembly language. It’s like turning complex text into something a machine can understand!
